<h3 class="center-title">A Library for Evaluating World Models üåé</h3>

**stable-worldmodel (s-wm) is a Python library for world model evaluation across wide range of environment and variations.** The library is composed of a set of [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environment. s-wm not only provide an evaluation benchmark but also the api to add new environment and some utilities based on [stable-pretraining](https://github.com/randall-lab/stable-pretraining) to easily iterate and train new world model.
