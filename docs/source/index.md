**Minari is a Python API that hosts a collection of popular Offline Reinforcement Learning datasets.** The environments from which these datasets are generated follow the [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). The datasets are publicly available in a [Farama GCP bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/minari-remote) and can be downloaded through the Minari CLI. Minari also provides dataset handling features such as episode sampling, filtering trajectories, as well as dataset generation utilities.
